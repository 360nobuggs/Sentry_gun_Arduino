# Sentry_gun_Arduino
A modified air freshener to act as a Sentry gun

This project envolved modifying an air freshener to a circuit level in order for it to act as a human detection device, using an Arduino board it was posssible for me to implement both a thermal sensor and a distance sensor.And with anadded servo to add mobility i came up with a prototype that shoots pleasant aroma on anyone that it detects.
